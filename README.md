Spud
===

RBE 2001 Team 2 A14 code for the final project.

This code runs our robot, Spud. The robot was designed to complete the RBE 2001 challenge: changing the "nuclear fuel rods" in the "nuclear reactors". This challenge is designed to simulate a task that a robot  might have to do in the real world. The challenge requires the robot to complete the entire task autonomously, and  use sensors to determine the state of field elements  to be able ot successfully complete the task. It also  requires the robot to communicate to the field computer  over bluetooth to exchange information about the  availability and positioning of fuel rods.

Building
---

To build the code, simply clone the project from Github. Then open Final_Arduino.ino in the Arduino IDE, and deploy to the robot using the "Upload" button. This project can also be opened in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) and built using the [Stino](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino) plugin. We developed it in Sublime.
